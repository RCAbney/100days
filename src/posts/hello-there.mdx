2020 is here and the wonderful humans at [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/) have created the 100 Days of Gatsby challenge.

I started using Gatsby last year after discovering the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/). That led me to Gatsby, where their selling point is 'helping developers build blazing fast websites and apps.'

Aside from that pitch, I also decided to use Gatsby because it uses [React](https://reactjs.org), which I've been building small projects with for sometime. After tinkering away with tutorials, courses, and small projects, I decided that it's time to redo my personal site. Around the same time Gatsby announced their "100 Days" challenge so I decided that I'll use that as motivation to get my site redone.
