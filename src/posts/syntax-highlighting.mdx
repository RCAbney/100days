Syntax highlighting was something I took for granted. For some reason I was assuming that markdown/mdx would let you do it by default. That's not the case, but luckily there's a way to quickly set up syntax highlighting in Gatsby by using [gatsby-remark-embedder.](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-embedder/)

Here's a [link on Egghead.io to a great tutorial](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-syntax-highlighting-code-blocks-using-components-with-prism-react-renderer-and-gatsby-mdx) by Chris Biscardi.

let's do some syntax highlighting in gatsby

Here's some CSS

```css
body {
  font-size: 16px;
  color: #fff;
  background-color: #000;
}
```

now a javascript one

```js
let foo = bar
const sum = (a, b) => a + b
```
