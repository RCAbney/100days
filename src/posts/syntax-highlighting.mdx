let's do some syntax highlighting in gatsby

Here's some CSS

```css
body {
  font-size: 16px;
  color: #fff;
  background-color: #000;
}
```

now a javascript one

```js
let foo = bar
const sum = (a, b) => a + b
```

How about some HTML?

```html
<section>
  <h1>Taco Bell!</h1>
  <p>Taco Bell is America's favorite place to eat rite?</p>
</section>
```
